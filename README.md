The SocialAI frontend allows users to interact with an AI-based platform where they can generate custom images using natural language descriptions and manage their personal collection of saved images. This frontend was built with React and provides a smooth user experience with features like image generation, collection management, and search functionalities.

Features
Image Generation: Users can input natural language descriptions to generate custom images using OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API.
Image Collection Management: Users can save generated images to their personal collection, view their collection, and manage images.
Search Functionality: Integrated Elasticsearch in the backend to allow users to search images by keywords.
